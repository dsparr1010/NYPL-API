Coding Assessment (Python)
Thank you for considering the New York Public Library! When we interview candidates for
engineering positions, we want to give them an assignment that aligns with the work we are
doing here.
What is involved?
Write a web API with one endpoint that takes an argument in its URL string, does something
interesting to the argument, and returns the result in a JSON document. Use the Python web
framework of your choice. Document the endpoint and write a unit test to verify its functionality.
How long do I have?
Please don't spend more than two hours on this project. Our goal is to get a picture of the way
you approach problems; it shouldn't be necessary to write more than 200 lines of code.
How do I submit my assignment?
Please provide us with a ZIP file containing source code or a link to a Git repository.
